		<p>My name is Sanjana Gupta and I am an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in B.S. Neurobiology with aspirations of going into medicine. My life beagn in India, in a city called Meerut, and I grew up there close to my extended family for 12 years. In 2007, my parents decided to move to U.S. to ascertain better educational and career opportunties, and that is how we ended up in Texas. I completed my secondary education from Temple high school where I took an interest in tennis and non-profit work of Amnesty International organization. After high school, I applied to natural sciences college at UT Austin, and I am now in the process of completing my second year here. </p>
